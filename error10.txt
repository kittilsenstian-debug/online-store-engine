Since no users currently exist, you must create the first admin user using the Medusa CLI tool via your server's terminal. 
Ensure your Medusa server is running.
Open your terminal and navigate to your Medusa application's root directory.
Run the following command, replacing <email> with your desired email address and <password> with your new secure password:
bash
npx medusa user -e <email> -p <password>
Vær forsiktig når du bruker koden

For example:
bash
npx medusa user -e admin@example.com -p mySecurePassword123
Vær forsiktig når du bruker koden

The command will create an admin user in your database with the specified credentials.
You can now log in to your Medusa Admin dashboard (usually at http://localhost:9000/app) using these credentials. 
Alternatively, when you first set up the project, running the medusa new command with the --seed option would have automatically created a default user with the credentials admin@medusa-test.com and supersecret. If you used this option, you can log in with those default credentials immediately.
