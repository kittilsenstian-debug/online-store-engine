Help me to debug the attached sql snippet which gives the following error:

Reasoned
I'll list the tables in your database (public and relevant schemas) to check where these tables live and whether their names differ or are namespaced. I'll call the list_tables tool with schemas public, auth, storage, realtime.


Ran list_tables

Reasoned
Summary
Cause: Your DELETE failed because the table name in the SQL (auth_provider) does not exist in the database. From the schema listing, I can see several auth-related tables — e.g. auth.sso_providers, auth.saml_providers, auth.identities, and in public schema provider_identity — but no table named auth_provider.

Recommendations / Fixes
If you intended to delete SSO provider rows in the auth schema, use the correct table name and column. For example, to remove a SAML provider with entity_id (column name in this DB is entity_id on auth.saml_providers) you can run:
SQL Query



DELETE FROM auth.saml_providers WHERE entity_id = 'user_01K9ZSQWQ3SSXCE9W9R3JJ0V55';

If you intended to delete identity/provider records linked to the application user, consider these tables that exist in your DB:
auth.identities (has provider, identity_data, user_id)
auth.sso_providers (resource_id)
auth.saml_providers (entity_id)
auth.sso_domains (sso_provider_id)
auth.sessions (user_id)
public.provider_identity (has entity_id column)
public.auth_identity (you have a public.auth_identity table but not auth_identity — note schema mismatch)
Example safe sequence to remove related rows for that user id (adapt to exact IDs and desired scope). These statements use the actual table names present in your DB. Run them only if you intend to permanently delete:
Remove from public.provider_identity by entity_id:
SQL Query



DELETE FROM public.provider_identity
WHERE entity_id = 'user_01K9ZSQWQ3SSXCE9W9R3JJ0V55';

Remove from public.auth_identity (exists in public):
SQL Query



DELETE FROM public.auth_identity
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT auth_identity_id FROM public.provider_identity
  WHERE entity_id = 'user_01K9ZSQWQ3SSXCE9W9R3JJ0V55'
);

(Only needed if you want to cascade deletes and if foreign key relationships permit.)

Remove sessions from auth.sessions by user UUID (note: auth.sessions.user_id is uuid; your provided id looks like a custom string — confirm value):
SQL Query



DELETE FROM auth.sessions
WHERE user_id = '<actual-uuid-of-user>';

Important: the value 'user_01K9ZSQWQ3SSXCE9W9R3JJ0V55' looks like an application-level id (Medusa/other) not the Auth schema UUID. Confirm whether the entity_id column or user_id column holds that value in the respective table before deleting.

How to proceed (pick one)
If you want, I can:
(A) Build exact DELETE statements for the tables you want to clean up once you confirm which table(s) and which column contain 'user_01K9ZSQWQ3SSXCE9W9R3JJ0V55' (and confirm you want permanent deletion).
(B) Run queries to show rows matching that identifier across candidate tables (I can prepare SQL SELECTs and execute them if you confirm). Choose A or B and confirm whether I should execute any destructive statements.
